<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
<p align="center">Hey there! I’m Leo John Aducal, hailing from the scenic Antipolo City. Currently, I'm a Grade 11 student at Antipolo City Senior High School, where I’m working hard on my studies while also finding time for my interests. I’m an avid cat lover—there’s just something about their playful yet calm nature that I find fascinating.

When it comes to style, I’m all about black and gray; those colors just feel right and suit my personality. Outside of school, you can usually find me indulging in some of my favorite pastimes. I love swimming, which keeps me active, and I’m also a big fan of catching up on sleep to recharge. But nothing beats the thrill of a good road trip; I’m always ready to explore new places, enjoy the open road, and create memories with friends or family.
